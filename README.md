# Sherlock MCP for .NET

**Sherlock MCP for .NET** is a powerful tool that provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for .NET assemblies. It allows Language Learning Models (LLMs) to analyze and understand your .NET code, enabling more accurate and context-aware responses.

This tool is ideal for developers who want to leverage the power of LLMs to:

*   Understand complex .NET codebases.
*   Get detailed information about types, members, and their signatures.
*   Automate code analysis and documentation.
*   Build custom tools that interact with .NET assemblies.

## Key Features

*   **MCP Server**: Provides a standardized interface for LLMs to interact with .NET assemblies.
*   **Assembly Analysis**: Uses reflection to extract detailed information about types, members, and their signatures.
*   **Rich Toolset**: Analyze assemblies, types, methods, properties, fields, events, and constructors.
*   **Attributes & XML Docs**: Surface member/parameter attributes and adjacent XML documentation (summary/params/returns/remarks).
*   **Filtering & Paging**: Name/attribute filters, sorting, and paging for large result sets.
*   **Stable Schemas**: Standard JSON envelopes with `kind` and `version`; consistent error codes.
*   **.NET 9.0 Support**: Built on the latest version of the .NET platform.
*   **Easy to Use**: Can be easily integrated into your existing workflows.

## Installation

To use Sherlock MCP for .NET, you can install it from NuGet:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g Sherlock.MCP.Server
```

## Usage

To configure Sherlock MCP as a custom tool in an IDE that supports the Model Context Protocol (such as Cursor), follow these steps:

1.  **Open your IDE's settings.**
2.  **Navigate to the MCP or custom tools section.**
3.  **Add a new server configuration.**
4.  **For the command, enter `sherlock-mcp`.**

Once configured, your IDE will be able to use Sherlock MCP for deep .NET code analysis.

## Available Tools

Sherlock MCP for .NET provides the following tools for analyzing .NET assemblies:

*   `AnalyzeAssembly`: Analyzes a .NET assembly and returns information about all public types, their members, and metadata.
*   `AnalyzeType`: Gets detailed information about a specific type including all its members, methods, properties, and fields.
*   `AnalyzeMethod`: Gets detailed information about a method and all overloads.
*   `FindAssemblyByClassName`: Searches for an assembly by its class name in common binary folders.
*   `FindAssemblyByFileName`: Searches for an assembly by its file name in common binary folders.
*   `GetAllTypeMembers`: Gets comprehensive member information for a type, including all methods, properties, fields, events, and constructors.
*   `GetTypeConstructors`: Gets detailed information about all constructors in a type.
*   `GetTypeEvents`: Gets detailed information about all events in a type.
*   `GetTypeFields`: Gets detailed information about all fields in a type.
*   `GetTypeMethods`: Gets detailed information about all methods in a type.
*   `GetTypeProperties`: Gets detailed information about all properties in a type.
*   `GetMemberAttributes`: Returns attributes for a single member (method/property/field/event/constructor).
*   `GetParameterAttributes`: Returns attributes for a specific parameter (method/constructor).

Additionally, the following tools provide higherâ€‘level project and type analysis:

*   `GetTypesFromAssembly`: Lists public types from an assembly with metadata.
*   `GetTypeInfo`: Returns rich metadata for a single type.
*   `GetTypeHierarchy`: Shows inheritance chain and implemented interfaces.
*   `GetGenericTypeInfo`: Details generic parameters, arguments, and variance.
*   `GetTypeAttributes`: Returns custom attributes applied to a type.
*   `GetNestedTypes`: Lists nested types declared on a type.
*   `GetXmlDocsForType`: Loads XML docs for a type from an adjacent `.xml` file.
*   `GetXmlDocsForMember`: Loads XML docs for a member (method/property/field/event/ctor).
*   `AnalyzeSolution`: Parses a `.sln` and lists contained projects.
*   `AnalyzeProject`: Parses a project file and returns metadata, refs, and outputs.
*   `GetProjectOutputPaths`: Computes output folders for a given configuration.
*   `ResolvePackageReferences`: Resolves NuGet package references to local assemblies in the cache.
*   `FindDepsJsonDependencies`: Reads deps.json files to surface runtime dependencies.

### Member Listing Options

All member listing tools (methods/properties/fields/events/constructors) accept:

* `caseSensitive` (bool): Case-sensitive type/member matching (default false in tools).
* `nameContains` (string): Filter members by substring.
* `hasAttributeContains` (string): Filter by attribute type substring.
* `skip` / `take` (int): Paging over results.
* `sortBy` / `sortOrder`: Sort by name/access; asc/desc.

Type lookup supports full names, simple names, and nested types (normalized `Outer+Inner`); `caseSensitive` controls comparison.

### Response Schema

All tools return a stable JSON envelope:

```jsonc
{ "kind": "type.list|member.methods|...", "version": "1.0.0", "data": { /* result */ } }
```

Errors use a consistent shape:

```jsonc
{ "kind": "error", "version": "1.0.0", "code": "AssemblyNotFound|TypeNotFound|InvalidArgument|InternalError", "message": "...", "details": { } }
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. This repo includes an `.editorconfig` with modern C# preferences (file-scoped namespaces, expression-bodied members, 4-space indentation). Please:

* Keep changes small and focused; add unit tests for new behavior.
* Follow the response envelope and error code conventions when adding tools.
* Run `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` locally before opening a PR.
