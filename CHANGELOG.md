## [2.7.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Inspection tools no longer fail with `Could not load file or assembly` when inspected types reference attributes whose dependencies are absent on disk. The default inspection context now uses `System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext` (inspection-only) instead of loading assemblies into the default `AssemblyLoadContext`, so attribute metadata is readable without resolving the attribute's runtime dependencies. Six MLC-incompatible reflection patterns (attribute lookups, `typeof()` type comparisons, `GetBaseDefinition`, `DefaultValue`) were migrated to MLC-safe equivalents. (#19)
